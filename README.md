# Educational Bitcoin Phrase Scanner (Controlled Version)

> **WARNING:** This repository contains an **educational** script that generates Bitcoin addresses from `word + year` phrases and can optionally query a blockchain API. **Do not** use this tool to scan, access, or attempt to access other people's wallets or funds ‚Äî that is illegal and unethical. By default, network requests are **disabled**. If you enable network access (`ENABLE_NETWORK = True`), use it **only** for addresses you own or on a Bitcoin testnet.

---

## üîé Overview

This Python script generates Bitcoin P2PKH addresses from simple phrase patterns (word + year or two-digit year), optionally checks address activity and balance via the Blockstream API, and records results. It is intended **only for learning, testing and research**.

Main features:

- Randomized processing order
- Modes: `shuffle_phrases`, `random_year`, `infinite_random`
- Exponential backoff for HTTP requests
- Multiprocessing support (parallel workers)
- Results saved to `found_words.txt` (addresses with balance) and `active_words.txt` (addresses with transaction history)
- Default behavior: **no network requests** (`ENABLE_NETWORK = False`)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Ethics

- **Do not** enable `ENABLE_NETWORK` to scan or probe addresses you do not own.
- Prefer `USE_TESTNET = True` with `ENABLE_NETWORK = True` when experimenting with network queries.
- `SAVE_PRIVATE = False` by default ‚Äî the script does **not** save private keys unless you explicitly enable this (not recommended).
- This tool is for educational purposes: learning address derivation, testing flows, or validating logging/IO behavior.

## üìÅ Repo layout (example)

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pi_wallet_hunter.py     # Main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ found_words.txt         # Addresses found with non-zero balance (appended)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ active_words.txt        # Addresses with tx history (appended)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Required Python packages
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (top of `pi_wallet_hunter.py`)

Edit these values at the top of the script to control behavior:

```python
WORDLIST_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt"
YEARS = list(range(1903, 2014))   # Years appended to words (inclusive range)

ENABLE_NETWORK = False            # False = no network queries (safe default)
USE_TESTNET = False               # If network enabled, use testnet endpoints
MODE = "shuffle_phrases"          # "shuffle_phrases" | "random_year" | "infinite_random"
NUM_PROCS = min(cpu_count(), 4)   # Max number of parallel processes (cap to CPU)
RANDOM_YEARS_PER_WORD = 10        # Number of random years per word (random_year mode)
SAVE_PRIVATE = False              # Save private key (WIF) to file ‚Äî NOT recommended
RATE_SLEEP = 0.05                 # Pause between address checks to avoid rate pressure
```

### Change years used in generation
Modify the `YEARS` list. Examples:

```python
# Years 1970 through 2000 inclusive
YEARS = list(range(1970, 2001))

# Or a custom list
YEARS = [1969, 1976, 1984, 1999, 2010]
```

## üîß Installation

1. Clone or copy repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fh0enix/Educational-Bitcoin-Phrase-Scanner.git
cd Educational-Bitcoin-Phrase-Scanner
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the script

Run with Python:

```bash
python pi_wallet_hunter.py
```

Default behavior is **offline** (no network). Console output shows worker progress lines such as:

```
[W1] 4/92526 'example1970' ‚Üí Bal: 0.0, Act: False
```

- `W1` ‚Äî worker ID
- `4/92526` ‚Äî progress in that worker's chunk
- `'example1970'` ‚Äî phrase checked
- `Bal` ‚Äî balance (BTC)
- `Act` ‚Äî whether address has transaction history

### Enable live network checks (only for owned/test addresses)
Set in script:
```python
ENABLE_NETWORK = True
USE_TESTNET = True   # strongly recommended for testing
```

Then run the script. Be mindful of API rate limits and legal/ethical constraints.

---

## üìÑ Output files

- `found_words.txt` ‚Äî appended lines for any phrase/address with `balance > 0`
- `active_words.txt` ‚Äî appended lines for addresses with transactions (`tx_count > 0`)

Line format:
```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] <phrase> | <address> | <balance> BTC | active:<True/False> | wif:<optional WIF>
```
(`wif` is present only if `SAVE_PRIVATE = True`)

---

## üõ† Implementation notes

- Private key derivation: the script uses `SHA-256(phrase)` as a simple private key seed (educational only). This is **not** BIP39/BIP32 ‚Äî do not use for real wallets.
- Address type: simple uncompressed **P2PKH** constructed from the verifying key.
- The script uses the Blockstream Esplora API for address stats when network is enabled.
- The address space is astronomically large; brute-forcing funded addresses is infeasible and unethical.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended safe workflow (for learning)

1. Keep `ENABLE_NETWORK = False` while testing locally to verify generation logic.
2. If you want to check actual balances for addresses you control, create a test wallet on Bitcoin testnet and set:
```python
ENABLE_NETWORK = True
USE_TESTNET = True
```
3. Consider adding logging rotation or limiting output if running for long periods.
4. **Never** use this tool to try to access others' funds. Doing so may be illegal.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Permission or missing Python**: Ensure `python` or `py -3` is available and points to Python 3.8+.
- **Windows launch errors (`/usr/bin/env`)**: Run the script directly using `python pi_wallet_hunter.py` or configure your editor to use the system Python.
- **Rate limiting**: The script includes exponential backoff‚Äîstill, keep `RATE_SLEEP` conservative and prefer `USE_TESTNET = True` during tests.
- **Pylance/type hints issues**: If your IDE warns about `Lock` type annotations, remove or simplify the annotation (e.g., `lock: Any` or `lock` only).
